Ditaa-live
==========

[Ditaa](http://ditaa.sourceforge.net/) is command-line utility written in
Java, that can convert diagrams drawn using ascii art into proper bitmap
graphics. Ditaa-live is a golang web server that show the generated images
from ditaa. But the most important thing is that the image is automatically
reloaded when the ditaa file is modified. It works by opening a websocket
connection to the server that will monitor the file with inotify (Linux-only).

**Note**: ditaa-live only works in a browser that supports WebSocket,
i.e. Chrome or Firefox.
